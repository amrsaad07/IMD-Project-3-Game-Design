<h1>About the game</h1>
<p>Hungary Hero is a light and fun 2D game where your character grows bigger every time it eats a treat. The idea is easy to understand. You move around the map, collect food, and watch your character become larger with every bite. As you get bigger, the game becomes more exciting and a bit harder to move around, which makes each round feel different. It is inspired by the classic “eat and grow” style of games, but with a more playful and friendly vibe. Your goal is to keep eating, stay alive, and try to become the largest hero on the screen.</p>
